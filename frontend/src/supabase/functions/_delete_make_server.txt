This file indicates that the make-server directory should be deleted as it conflicts with the existing server function.

To fix the 403 deployment error:
1. Delete /supabase/functions/make-server/ directory completely
2. Use the existing /supabase/functions/server/ which already handles all required endpoints
3. The API base URL should point to: https://mppuexmnibtwvvyuzdxa.supabase.co/functions/v1/server

The existing server function already handles:
- Health check at /make-server-ac827602/health
- Authentication at /make-server-ac827602/api/auth/login
- Relief centers at /make-server-ac827602/api/relief
- Profile management endpoints

No duplicate edge function needed.
